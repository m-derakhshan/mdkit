## üì¶ Installation

Add JitPack to your `settings.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven(url = "https://jitpack.io")
    }
}
````

Then include the library in your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
       implementation("com.github.m-derakhshan.mdkit:floating_view:$LATEST_VERSION")
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

The usage is very simple, all you need is providing a floating view state and then you can use floating view composable.
Floating view, should be used inside of a `Box`. but avoid setting `Modifier.align()` on it, as it will not work properly.

```kotlin
val floatingViewState = rememberFloatingViewState()
Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
    FloatingView(state = floatingViewState) {
        ...
    }
}
```
